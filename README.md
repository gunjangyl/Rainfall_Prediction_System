# Rainfall_Prediction_System

## 📖 Overview
The Rainfall Prediction System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict rainfall using meteorological data. It leverages various machine learning models to analyze factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure to estimate rainfall probability.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- ✅ Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics
- ✅ Web Interface (Optional for deployment)

## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis & model training
- **Flask (Optional)** for deploying a web interface

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes various meteorological parameters such as:
- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 💨 Wind Speed
- 🔽 Pressure
- 🌧️ Precipitation

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gunjangyl/Rainfall_Prediction_System.git
cd Rainfall_Prediction_System
cd myproject
```

2️⃣ Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ Run the system:
```bash
python mmanage.py runserver
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training
